## General Information
- Currently undertaking the Codecademy full stack engineer course. The current teaching are consolidating learnings in HTML, CSS and teaching the use of flexbox and responsive design. 
- The purpose of this project was to fix a piece of broken code for the Fotomatic webpage.
## Features
- Currently operates as a one-page site (therefore, the menu links don't work)
- Site is responsive to different screen sizes
## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ / _no longer being worked on_. 
This was a standalone task as part of the training course so no further work is required at this time. 
## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to Codecademy for providing the code outline as the basis for this project.
